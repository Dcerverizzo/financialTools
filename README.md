Financial Tools (Seu Barriga) - Node.js Project
===============================================

Overview
--------

Financial Tools, also known as "Seu Barriga," is a Node.js project developed for learning purposes. This project showcases my skills in API development using Node.js and the implementation of tests and code coverage using the Jest testing framework following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach.

Features
--------

-   Account Management: Create, update, and delete user accounts.
-   Transaction Handling: Record transactions, including deposits and withdrawals, associated with user accounts.
-   Balance Calculation: Calculate and retrieve the current balance for user accounts.
-   Categories: Categorize transactions for better financial tracking.
-   Test Coverage: Comprehensive unit tests using Jest with a focus on achieving high code coverage.

Technologies Used
-----------------

-   Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment.
-   Express.js: Web application framework for building APIs.
-   Jest: JavaScript testing framework for unit testing.
-   MongoDB: Database for storing user accounts and transactions.

Installation
------------

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Dcerverizzo/financial-tools.git`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd financial-tools`
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`

Usage
-----

1.  Start the server: `npm start`
2.  Access the API at `http://localhost:3000`

Testing
-------

Run tests using the following command:

bashCopy code

`npm test`

API Endpoints
-------------

-   `GET /accounts`: Retrieve a list of user accounts.
-   `POST /accounts`: Create a new user account.
-   `GET /accounts/:id`: Retrieve details of a specific user account.
-   `PUT /accounts/:id`: Update user account information.
-   `DELETE /accounts/:id`: Delete a user account.
-   `POST /transactions`: Add a transaction to a user account.
-   `GET /transactions/:accountId`: Retrieve transactions for a specific user account.

Test-Driven Development (TDD)
-----------------------------

This project follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure robustness and maintainability. Each feature is developed iteratively through the following steps:

1.  Write a failing test for the new feature.
2.  Implement the feature code to make the test pass.
3.  Refactor the code for better structure and readability.
4.  Run tests to ensure the feature and existing functionality still work.

Future Enhancements
-------------------

-   Authentication and user authentication.
-   Improved error handling and validation.
-   Enhanced logging and monitoring.
-   Integration with a frontend application.
